Introduction to Apache Any23

* Library

    <<Anything To Triples (any23)>> is a library, a web service and a command line tool that extracts structured data
    in RDF format from a variety of Web documents. Currently it supports the following input formats:

     * {{{http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-rdf-syntax/}RDF/XML}}, {{{http://www.w3.org/TeamSubmission/turtle/}Turtle}}, {{{http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/Notation3}Notation 3}}

     * {{{http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml-rdfa-primer/}RDFa}} with {{{http://www.w3.org/TR/2010/WD-rdfa-core-20100422/#scoping-of-prefix-mappings}RDFa1.1 prefix mechanism}}

     * {{{http://microformats.org/}Microformats1}} and {{{http://microformats.org/wiki/microformats-2}Microformats2}}: hAdr, hCard, hCalendar, hEntry, hEvent, hGeo, hItem, hListing, hProduct, hProduct, hRecipie, hResume, hReview, License, Species, XFN, etc

     * {{{http://json-ld.org/}JSON-LD}}: JSON for Linking Data. a lightweight Linked Data format based on the already successful JSON format and provides a way to help JSON data interoperate at Web-scale.

     * {{{http://dev.w3.org/html5/md/}HTML5 Microdata}}: (such as {{{http://schema.org}Schema.org}})

     * {{{http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4180.txt}CSV}}: Comma Separated Values with separator autodetection.

     * Vocabularies: Extraction support for {{{http://dublincore.org/}Dublin Core Terms}}, {{{http://www.w3.org/wiki/DescriptionOfACareerVocabulary}Description of a Career}}, {{{https://github.com/edumbill/doap/wiki}Description Of A Project}}, {{{http://xmlns.com/foaf/spec/}Friend Of A Friend}}, {{{http://www.geonames.org/ontology/}GEO Names}}, {{{http://www.w3.org/2002/12/cal/icaltzd#}ICAL}}, {{{https://github.com/RinkeHoekstra/lkif-core}lkif-core}}, {{{http://ogp.me/}Open Graph Protocol}}, {{{http://purl.org/ontology/po/}BBC Programmes Ontology}}, {{{http://vocab.org/review/terms.html}RDF Review Vocabulary}}, {{{http://schema.org/}schema.org}}, {{{http://www.w3.org/2006/vcard/ns}VCard}}, {{{http://purl.org/ontology/wo/}BBC Wildlife Ontology}} and {{{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml/vocab/}XHTML}}... and more!

     * {{{http://www.yaml.org/}YAML}}: human friendly data serialization standard for all programming languages.

     * Additionally, as of 2.1 Any23 provides functionality to extract triples using the {{{https://github.com/allenai/openie-standalone}Open Information Extraction (Open IE) system}}. The Open IE system runs over sentences and creates extractions that represent relations in text, in the case of Any23, this results in triples.


    A detailed description of available extractors is {{{./extractors.html}here}}.
