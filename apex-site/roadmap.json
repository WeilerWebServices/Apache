The mechanics of an user requesting the attribute change can be similar to how a user requests property change via the command line client.\n\nSince each attribute is different the actual backend implementation to affect the changes will most likely be custom handling for different attributes but during the implementation process  hopefully some common themes emerge and some amount of reuse possible.",

A bug is discovered in an operator and an existing operator in the running DAG needs to be replaced. The platform supports shutting down and resuming an application which could be use as a first cut way to do this but there are a couple of drawbacks.\n       i. This only works when the input source has memory, if it doesn't the messages received during the time the application is down are lost.\n      ii. Depending on the complexity and state of the application it may take some time for this entire process and the application to get back to running state and this delay may not be acceptable for the downstream components that depend on the output of this application.\n\nb. A new operator needs to be added to the DAG to take data from an existing operator and do some additional processing. Today this is supported as long as the code for the operator is already in the application libraries. Often this will not be the case as users will not know what the operator will be beforehand when the application is originally launched.",

A cursory look suggests that Mesos support can be added by reimplementing the YARN specific portions in the master (AppMasterService, ContainerLauncher) and limited changes to the streaming container driver.\n\nMesos has a different model of resource allocation: The master offers resources to the framework while in YARN resources are requested. Apex master needs to implement the \"framework scheduler\" that is responsible to accept the resources and control the tasks.\n\nhttp://mesos.apache.org/documentation/latest/app-framework-development-guide/\n\nTasks are launched through executors, command line and docker executors are provided.  \n\nApex also requires support to deploy the dependencies to the nodes on which the streaming containers are launched. YARN supports that through resource localization. Mesos supports this through the fetcher, which can copy the resources to the slave node.\n\nhttp://mesos.apache.org/documentation/latest/fetcher/\n",
