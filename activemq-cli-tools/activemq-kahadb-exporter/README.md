Apache ActiveMQ KahaDB Exporter
===============================

The ActiveMQ KahaDB exporter project provides a means to export the
ActiveMQ 5.x Broker's native KahaDB message store which can be consumed by
other tooling such as import into the ActiveMQ Artemis broker's native format
to aid with broker migration.
