<h1>Ant Tasks</h1>
EasyAnt comes with a few Ant tasks, that can be used in your module.ant file or in your own plugin.

Most of them are already used by easyant itself.

To use those tasks you should add the following namespace to your ant header.
<code type="xml">
xmlns:ea="antlib:org.apache.easyant"
</code>

Example :
<code type="xml">
<project name="foobar" xmlns:ea="antlib:org.apache.easyant">
</code>

Then you could be able to call the EasyAnt ant tasks with the prefix "ea".
Example : 
<code type="xml">
<project name="foobar" xmlns:ea="antlib:org.apache.easyant">
        <ea:core-version requiredrevision="[0.6,+]" />
</project>
</code>
