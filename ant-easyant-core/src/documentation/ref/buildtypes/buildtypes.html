<h1>Build Types</h1>

A "Build Type" identifies at a high level how you want a single module in your project to be built.  Building a module typically includes many steps like compilation, source generation, unit testing, packaging, and build reporting.  For example, the build type build-webapp-java compiles, tests, and packages a Java WAR file.

A BuildType is typically implemented as an Ant script, an Ivy descriptor, and a properties file.  The Ivy descriptor is used by EasyAnt to load the Build Type as runtime.  The Ant Script is executed whenever you build a module using that Build Type.  Most Build Type scripts simply import a set of <a href="../plugins/plugins.html">EasyAnt Plugins</a>, each plugin contributing one step to the build process.

For example, the build-std-java Build Type imports the compile-java plugin to compile Java sources and the package-jar plugin to bundle the results as a JAR file.  

A Build Type's properties file then contains default parameter settings used by the plugins; for example, the expected location of Java source and test files in a project directory.
