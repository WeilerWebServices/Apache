<h1>Directory structure</h1>
EasyAnt cames with a lot of convention, most of them are inspired by maven conventions. 

Those conventions can be configured through properties such as :
<ul> 
  <li>src.main.java</li>
  <li>src.main.resources</li>
  <li>src.test.java</li>
  <li>src.test.resources</li>
  <li>src.main.webapp</li>
  <li>src.documentation.dir</li>
</ul>

In this document will try to explain you the directory structure of standard EasyAnt project.

<h2>Standard directory structure</h2>

Standard directory structure looks like this :
<img src="../images/java-webapp-src-structure.gif" />

<h3>Separating project main code and test code</h3>
In a ideal world application may have some tests (functionnal / unit test / integration test, etc...).
This tests doesn't make sense at all to be shipped during the packaging phase of your application.
To avoid this, by default EasyAnt makes a separation between  
<ul>
  <li>project code</li>
  <li>test code</li>
</ul>


By convention, project code is stored in <i>src/main</i> directory</i>, whereas your test code is in <i>src/test</i> directory.

<h3>Separating source code and resources</h3>
To clarify the directory structure source files and resources are separated in two directory.

The directory structure of project source code looks like :
<ul>
  <li><i>src/main/java</i> for main source code (note that this can be configured through the property <i>src.main.java</i>)</li>
  <li><i>src/main/resources</i> for resource files (note that this can be configured through the property <i>src.main.resources</i>)</li>
</ul>

The directory structure of test source code:
<ul>
  <li><i>src/test/java</i> for test source code (note that this can be configured through the property <i>src.test.java</i>)</li>
  <li><i>src/test/resources</i> for test resource files (note that this can be configured through the property <i>src.test.resources</i>)</li>
</ul>

<div id="note">
Note: this also apply with non-java project (like groovy / scala project). 
<h4>Groovy project</h4>
<ul>
  <li><i>src/main/groovy</i> for main source code (note that this can be configured through the property <i>src.main.groovy</i>)</li>
  <li><i>src/test/groovy</i> for test source code (note that this can be configured through the property <i>src.test.groovy</i>)</li>
</ul>

<h4>Scala project</h4>
<ul>
  <li><i>src/main/scala</i> for main source code (note that this can be configured through the property <i>src.main.scala</i>)</li>
  <li><i>src/test/scala</i> for test source code (note that this can be configured through the property <i>src.test.scala</i>)</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h2>WebApp ressources</h2>
By convention, WebApp ressources are stored in <i>src/main/webapp</i>.
This can be adapted through the property <i>src.main.webapp</i> 

<h2>Documentation files</h2>
By convention, documentation files are stored in <i>src/documentation</i>.
You can configure it through the property named <i>src.documentation.dir</i>.</textarea>
