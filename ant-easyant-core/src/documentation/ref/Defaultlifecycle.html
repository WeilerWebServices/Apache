<h1>Default lifecycle</h1>

EasyAnt cames with a default lifecycle. This default lifecycle is a set of predefined <a href="ExtensionPoint.html">extension points</a> for the common needs.   

Each phase is considered as an essential step of the build process.
<div id="note">
Note : Even if EasyAnt provides you a default lifecycle we never lock you in. So you're able to add your own extension points or to override existing ones.
</div>

Here is a graphical representation of the default lifecycle.

<img src="../images/defaultLifecycle.jpg"/>

<p>
Standard <a href="buildtypes/buildtypes.html">build types</a> import the default lifecycle. It's buildtype responsability to wire plugins on the default lifecycle.

Users can bind or rebind targets on it. This can be achieved with <a href="anttasks/BindTarget.html">bindtarget ant task</a>.
</p>

<p>
Plugins can provides additionnal <a href="ExtensionPoint.html">extension points</a>. Plugins typically add low-level tasks to one or more extension-points. For example, a plugin can contribute to processing sources before compilation, you will in that case plug your own target to "abstract-compile:compile-ready" extension-point". This contributes to have a dynamic lifecycle. 

Default lifecycle is here to bring conventions through high level targets. It ease to memorize common steps.
