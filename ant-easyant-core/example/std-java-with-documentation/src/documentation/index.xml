<section name="EasyAnt">

<p>Easyant is a toolbox focusing on easing project build processes.
It's based on Apache Ant and Apache Ivy, and allows for maximum flexibily, improved integration in existing build systems and provides conventions and guidelines.
Our goals are :
<ul>
<li>to simplify build process by providing a set of ready to use build scripts (or modules) to ease the implementation of build system.</li>
<li>to provide conventions and guidelines</li>
<li>to leverage your ant knowledge (no need to learn another language)</li>
<li>remain adaptable :</li>
<ul>
<li>what about conventions ? : Even if Easyant comes with a lot of conventions, we never lock you in.</li>
<li>what about modules ? : You can easily adapt it to your projects. The architecture of Easyant allows you to easily extends existing modules and to provide your own one.</li>
<li>what if you already have an existing project ? Since Easyant is fully based on top of ant, you can keep your existing project along with the "old school" ant scripts. This should ease the migration to Easyant.</li> 
</ul>
</ul>
